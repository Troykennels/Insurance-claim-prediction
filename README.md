# Insurance Claim Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether an insured building will experience at least one insurance claim using machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset contains building characteristics, policy details, and claim outcomes.

## Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and handling missing values
- Model training and improvement
- Model evaluation using ROC-AUC, precision, and recall

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression (class-weighted)
- Random Forest (hyperparameter tuned)
- Gradient Boosting

## Results
Gradient Boosting and tuned Random Forest models achieved the best performance based on ROC-AUC.

## Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
